    # Mimics ActiveRecords +find_by_sql+. Performs query and populates

    # Wraps +find_by_sql+ by simply adding LIMIT and OFFSET to your SQL string
    # based on the params otherwise used by paginating finds: +page+ and

    # Example:
    #
    # @developers = Developer.paginate_by_sql ['select * from developers where salary > ?', 80000],
    #                          :page => params[:page], :per_page => 3
    #
    # A query for counting rows will automatically be generated if you don't
    # supply <tt>:total_entries</tt>. If you experience problems with this
    # generated SQL, you might want to perform the count manually in your
    # application.
