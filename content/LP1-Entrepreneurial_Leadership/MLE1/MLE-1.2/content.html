<p>It seems like yesterday when I decided to start my own business. Friends of mine wanted me to do a small design job for their home. I was honored when they asked me to build a deck for them. They told me that they chose me to do the job because they trusted me and knew me well enough to know that I would do a good job. On the other hand, I remember many other friends who mocked me when I told them about this small project. Most of them thought that a deck was not a "big enough project" for someone who had spent all that time and money going to architecture school. Finally, I ignored those negative comments and decided to design the deck for my friends. At that point, my company, AV Architects &amp; Builders, was born. Today, I successfully build custom homes, so I am proud of myself for not listening to those negative comments, and for listening to my gut feelings.</p>

<p>I knew I had to start my business small since I had all four kids at home and my time was limited. There were many nights that I would be working until 2 a.m., while the rest of my family was sleeping. For several years, I grew AV Architects one client at a time, one small project at a time. I have come a long way from being that young working mom, riding the metro to work with her young baby at her feet. I have been encouraged, I have been diligent, I have been supported, and now I can say I have been successful.<sup>2</sup></p>
